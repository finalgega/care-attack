			Caregiving can trigger a host of difficult emotions, including anger,
			fear, resentment, guilt, helplessness, and grief. It's important to
			acknowledge and accept what you're feeling, both good and bad. Don't
			beat yourself up over your doubts and misgivings. These feelings
			don't mean that you don't love your family memberâ€“they simply mean
			you're human.
